Through its practice-based research, **HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht** contributes to solutions for a wide range of societal issues. Issues submitted by our partners working in the field – at the regional, national and international level.

The **Smart Systems for Healthy Living** research group, led by [professor Matthijs Smakman], works on smart technological innovations to maintain and improve human well-being. Using new smart technology systems such as sensor technology, social robotics and 3D printing, we conduct practice-based research into innovative solutions to current health problems in three lines of research.
